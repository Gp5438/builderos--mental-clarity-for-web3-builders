# BuilderOS

A minimal mental health support tool for Web3 builders and contributors working in high-pressure, always-online environments.

## What It Is

BuilderOS is not a therapy app. It's a mental clarity utility that provides quick 2-3 minute resets for common mental states builders experience:

- Burned out
- Overwhelmed
- Distracted
- Anxious
- Low motivation
- Comparing self to others

Each reset includes:
- A rational grounding statement
- A short breathing instruction
- One practical micro-action

## Framework

Static HTML with Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS (CDN)

## Theme

Clean Light theme with soft shadows, neutral palette (gray-50 background, white cards), and blue accent color for actions. Designed for calm, minimal, and focused clarity.

## Features

- Single-page app
- No login required
- No chat or journaling
- Static content optimized for mental reset
- Guided breathing exercises
- Practical micro-actions

## Design Philosophy

Built for builders who need quick mental recalibration, not long-form therapy sessions. Direct, rational, actionable.
